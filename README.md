# DevConVT
An internal sample project written in .NET MVC 5, JavaScript and using Umbraco CMS system in order to exclude the role of the developer in future. 
The idea behind is to have a content management system where the employees of the company can attend a meeting or conference and to receive email as well as
give an info whether they are approved or not for the meeting.
Note: It still needs some development such as security of the email forms (if somehow the project is accessed by an externel user to protect it) and refactoring 
of the code (in order to make it cleaner and more readable)
